# Notification Infrastructure Status

## ✅ SMS/Twilio Infrastructure - FULLY CONFIGURED

### Status: **READY TO SEND SMS** (when Twilio credentials are configured)

### What's Set Up:
1. **Twilio SDK Installed**: `twilio@^5.8.2` in package.json
2. **SMS Service Module**: `src/lib/sms.ts` - Complete SMS service with:
   - Twilio client initialization
   - Phone number validation and formatting
   - SMS templates for all appointment types
   - Error handling and demo mode fallback
3. **API Endpoints**:
   - `/api/sms/send` - General SMS sending
   - `/api/sms/reminders` - Automated appointment reminders
   - `/api/appointments/[id]/confirm` - Sends SMS on confirmation
4. **Webhook Support**: `/api/webhooks/twilio` - Handles Twilio status updates

### How It Works:
- When you click "Confirm" on an appointment:
  1. The appointment status is updated to 'confirmed'
  2. `smsService.sendAppointmentConfirmation()` is called
  3. SMS is sent via Twilio API to customer's phone number
  4. Returns success/failure status with message ID

### Required Environment Variables:
```env
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_account_sid_here
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token_here
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1234567890  # Your Twilio phone number
```

### Current Behavior:
- **With Twilio credentials**: Sends real SMS via Twilio
- **Without Twilio credentials**: Runs in demo mode (logs SMS content, returns success)
- **Error handling**: Gracefully falls back to demo mode if credentials are invalid

### SMS Templates Available:
- ✅ Appointment Confirmation
- ✅ Appointment Reminder (24-hour)
- ✅ "On My Way" notification
- ✅ Service Complete notification
- ✅ Payment Reminder
- ✅ Weather Alert

## ⚠️ Email Infrastructure - PARTIALLY CONFIGURED

### Status: **READY FOR EMAIL SERVICE INTEGRATION** (currently logging only)

### What's Set Up:
1. **Email Logging**: When confirming appointments, email details are logged to console
2. **Email Data Collection**: Customer email addresses are collected and stored
3. **Email Templates**: Message content is formatted and ready

### What's Missing:
1. **Email Service Integration**: No email service (SendGrid, Resend, etc.) is currently integrated
2. **Email Sending Function**: Currently only logs to console instead of sending

### Current Behavior:
- When confirming an appointment:
  - Email content is logged to console
  - Returns `emailSent: true` in response (but no actual email is sent)
  - Logs show: `[EMAIL] Would send confirmation email to customer@email.com`

### Recommended Email Services:
1. **Resend** (Recommended for Next.js)
   - Simple API
   - Good Next.js integration
   - Free tier: 3,000 emails/month

2. **SendGrid**
   - Industry standard
   - Robust features
   - Free tier: 100 emails/day

3. **AWS SES**
   - Cost-effective at scale
   - Requires AWS setup
   - Free tier: 62,000 emails/month (if on EC2)

### Integration Needed:
To enable email sending, you would need to:
1. Install email service package (e.g., `npm install resend`)
2. Add environment variable (e.g., `RESEND_API_KEY`)
3. Update `/api/appointments/[id]/confirm/route.ts` to call email service
4. Create email templates (HTML/text)
