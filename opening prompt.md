Let's build a micro-SaaS web app for mobile car detailers to manage their business operations and convert more leads. The app is a simple, mobile-first dashboard that serves as a single source of truth for their business.

Help me think through how to break this into iterative pieces and write a plan.md.

Requirements:

Core Functionality: A simple web app for a detailer to manage their business. No client-side login or registration for the detailer in the MVP; a single, private link will serve as the initial access point for one user.

Client Booking Link: The detailer should have a public, shareable link (e.g., yourapp.com/book/detailer-id) where their customers can book appointments.

Automated Communication: When a customer books on the link, a scheduled text reminder is automatically sent to them 24 hours before the appointment.

Before-and-After Photos: The detailer can upload and store before and after photos linked to a specific customer's appointment. This is for documentation and portfolio purposes.

Stripe Payments: The detailer can send a Stripe invoice to the customer directly from the app after the job is complete. The app should be able to collect a small platform fee from each transaction (using Stripe Connect).

Pain Points to Address (as benefits):

Saves Time: Automates scheduling and communication, freeing up 15+ hours a week.

Reduces No-Shows: Automated text reminders significantly decrease no-show appointments.

Looks Professional: A custom booking link and digital invoicing make the detailer look more polished than their competitors.

Protects Business: Digital photo documentation provides proof of work and prevents disputes.

Design:

Minimal, functional, and clean UI.

Mobile-first, as detailers will be using this on their phones.

Use a neutral, dark-themed palette to be easy on the eyes.

Frontend:

Next.js 14 (App Router): For server-side rendering, API routes, and a robust framework.

React: For a component-based UI.

Tailwind CSS: For rapid UI development with a utility-first approach.

Shadcn/ui: For pre-built, accessible, and customizable components that integrate seamlessly with Tailwind.

Backend:

PostgreSQL Database: Reliable and scalable for structured data (users, appointments, photos, payments).

Supabase: All-in-one backend-as-a-service. It handles the PostgreSQL database, API layer, authentication (for future features), and file storage (for photos). It's incredibly fast to get started with.

Services & APIs:

Twilio: For sending automated SMS messages.

Stripe Connect: For handling payments and a platform fee.

Vercel: For easy deployment and serverless functions.

GitHub: For version control.

pnpm: For fast and efficient package management.


Check off items in the plan as we accomplish them as a to-do list. If you have open questions that require my input, add those to the plan as well. I'm ready to begin.
